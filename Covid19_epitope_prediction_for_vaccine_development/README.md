Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caused by SARS-COV-2 virus has become a global health crisis.  One hundred years have lapsed since the Spanish flu pandemic caused by the 
influenza A/H1N1 virus. The next pandemic maybe around the corner, on the heels of Covid-19. Will we be ready and be better armed with the tools to battle another contagion? 
Effective vaccines are the key to dampening the spread of virulent microorganisms. The impressive speed with which Covid-19 vaccines were developed and administered has 
undoubtedly saved countless lives. Expediting the process of vaccine development using in-silico vaccine design as a starting point will aid in narrowing down on an effective 
vaccine sooner. 

In this project, a relatively obscure dataset from Kaggle was used to identify possible Covid-19 epitope candidates which could be starting points for vaccine development. 
Using various related and unrelated peptides with specific features as well as their ability to evoke neutralizing antibody responses, I evaluated Machine Learning models’ 
ability in predicting the induction of anti- Covid-19 antibodies.  Surprisingly, many of these ‘candidates’ correspond to a small region of the spike protein of the virus. 
The spike protein is presumed to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cell membrane. This binding initiates virus internalization and hijacking 
of cellular machinery to replicate itself and release of new virus particles by exocytosis.  Antibodies binding to the spike protein can be expected to initiate destruction of 
the virus and may also prevent cell interaction and internalization.
