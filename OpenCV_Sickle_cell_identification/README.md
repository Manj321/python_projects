Sickle cell anaemia is an inherited blood disorder where the number of healthy red blood cells are insufficient to transport oxygen to the body. The presence of sickle- or crescent
moon-shaped cells among normal blood cells is a signature of this anaemia type. 

In this project, OpenCV was used to process an image of a blood film to identify and mark the sickle cells. The process of identification involved image thresholding, finding
contours around all blood cells followed by using image moments to separate normal round blood cells from the abnormal sickle cells. It is hoped that sickle cell differentiation 
using OpenCV image moments can help in automating cell identification as well as determination of the severity of the anaemia by cell counting.
