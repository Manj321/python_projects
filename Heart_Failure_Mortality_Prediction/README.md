Congestive heart failure also referred to as heart failure is a condition where the heart fails to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. Symptoms include shortness
of breath, muscle weakness and swelling of lower limbs. Risk factors that lead to heart failure are diabetes, obesity, hypertension and coronary artery disease. With more severe
heart failure, risk of mortality is over 50% within the first 12 months after diagnosis.

In this project, the goal is to be able to predict, using machine learning models, the survival outcome in patients with heart failure given the presence of various risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, 
smoking and anaemia as well as blood factors such as serum creatinine, serum sodium and creatinine phosphokinase.
